    "## 1) Lets Make a Deal\n",
    "Monte Carlo methods are often useful to ensure that our thinking is reasonable. A good\n",
    "example of this kind of use is to investigate a simple problem that generated much attention\n",
    "several years ago and for which many mathematicians obtained an incorrect solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem was the analysis of the optimal strategy in a television game show popular at\n",
    "the time. The show was Lets Make a Deal with host Monty Hall. At some point in the show,\n",
    "a contestant was given a choice of selecting one of three possible items, each concealed behind\n",
    "one of three closed doors. The items varied considerably in value.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the contestant made a choice but before the chosen door was opened, the\n",
    "host, who knew where the most valuable item was, would open one of the doors\n",
    "not selected and reveal a worthless item.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The host would then offer to let the contestant select a different door from what was originally\n",
    "selected. The question, of course, is should the contestant switch?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Much interest in this problem was generated when it was analyzed by a popular magazine\n",
    "writer, Marilyn vos Savant, who concluded that the optimal strategy is to switch. This\n",
    "strategy is counterintuitive to many mathematicians, who would say that there is nothing to\n",
    "be gained by switching; that is, that the probability of improving the selection is 0.5. Study\n",
    "this problem by Monte Carlo methods. Be careful to understand all of the assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Write a code that implement this test for 1000 “games” and determine that following:\n",
    "(a) Determine the probability of improving the selection by switching?**\n"
